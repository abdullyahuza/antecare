- Let's change the subject.

+ [*] breastfeeding [*]
- <b>Breastfeeding</b> is a natural way to feed your baby. It provides all the nutrition your baby needs during their first 6 months, and also helps to create a loving bond between you and your baby.

+ [*] (1st stage [of] [labor]|first stage [of] [labor]) [*]
- <b>1st stage of labor</b> begins with contractions that are close enough and strong enough to bring about a change in your cervical dilation. The first stage ends when you are 10 centimeters (cm) dilated

+ [*] pregnancy [*]
- <b>Pregnancy</b> occurs when a sperm fertilizes an egg after itâ€™s released from the ovary during ovulation. The fertilized egg then travels down into the uterus, where implantation occurs. A successful implantation results in pregnancy.\n
^On average, a full-term pregnancy lasts 40 weeks. There are many factors that can affect a pregnancy. Women who receive an early pregnancy diagnosis and prenatal care are more likely to experience a healthy pregnancy and give birth to a healthy baby.

+ [*] (2nd stage [of] [labor]|second stage [of] [labor]) [*]
- <b>2nd stage of labor</b> is pushing and delivery, which can last from 20 minutes to 3 or more hours.\n
^Contractions are slower, coming 2 to 5 minutes apart and last 60 to 90 seconds. With each contraction, you push until the baby moves down the birth canal.
